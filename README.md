Ever got logged out of your favourite social network and forgot the password you set years ago? Ever tried to remember a complex enough password to make sure your data is safe?

If you thought Yes, I did for any of the questions, our Biometric Voice ID Password Manager is just what you need!

We build a safe password storage with the following goals:

Empower people with memory disabilities, like Alzheimers disease, to be able to securely log into their services
Make safe and convenient password storage available on low-processing power smart devices (Watches, Bands,...)
Fill in the gap created by Face ID and Fingerprint sensors, making biometric authentication available in settings where those modalities are note available
Empower vision impaired people by giving them access to their password storage (Future Extension)
